# Welcome to Creative Coding!

## What is creative coding?

Creative coding is the practice of using code as an artform. Just like a painter chooses their paints, paintbrush, and canvas for self-expression and self-exploration, we can use code to do the same. Code can be our medium for sharing how we see the world.

We as coders, and the code we write, are only parts of the creative process and of our art. Creative coding lets us create algorithms for artwork that are generative â€“ that is, we code only the general instructions, and what we make is nothing we could have expected or imagined. Creative coding lets us connect our art with others across the world, allowing for multiplayer experiences that are not just our own.

Creative coding changes how we look at the world we are a part of. We begin to ask ourselves, "what are the patterns at play here?" How do we recreate those patterns in our code? How do we turn those patterns into things we've never seen before?

## P5.js and web development

We will primarily be using [**P5.js**](https://p5js.org/) for this course, which is a creative coding library written in Javascript. Javascript is one of the main languages used in modern web development, and we will be learning how to write Javascript through creative projects. By working with Javascript, we can easily put our creative projects onto our own websites and share them with others, and know that our projects will work the same on many different computers, tablets, and phones.

The other main languages we will use are HTML and CSS. You may be familiar with these. If Javascript is the muscles of a website, HTML is the bones, and CSS is the skin, hair, make-up and clothes. Or, HTML is what holds things together, and Javascript is what makes things move, while CSS makes things look pretty. We will be using a lot of Javascript and only a little HTML and CSS in this class.

## What we'll learn

We will learn how to write Javascript in P5.js to make art and games. We will learn ways to model natural phenomena in code so that our art looks and feels organic, [**inspired by nature**](natureofcode.com/). We will learn how to introduce randomness into our art, so that the algorithms we create are filled with surprise.

We will also learn how to create our own website and share our work with others. We will build a creative portfolio of our projects to show to friends, family, and to include in job and school applications. We will learn fundamental software skills and how to think like a programmer.
